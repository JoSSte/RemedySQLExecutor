# RemedySQLExecutor

SQL utility to execute SQL through your AR server's API to the backend server. 

Requires Administrator Privileges to be used.

## Notes
Note that the Remedy API is not using maven, and does not exist in the maven repository. You need to download the .jar file and put in a lib folder under your project root. See https://rrr.se/cgi/index?pg=arapi for downloads.
